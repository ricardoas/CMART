=====

C-MART is a benchmark designed to allow large scale testing with a modern web application. It is useful to not only benchmark server performance, but also test modern datacenter management algorithms such as dynamic scaling, quality of service, fault tolerance and load balancing algorithms.

Please visit the wiki for a brief walkthrough of the branch organization of this repository.
