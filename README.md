CMART
=====

C-MART is a benchmark designed to allow large scale testing with a modern web application. It is useful to not only benchmark server performance, but also test modern datacenter management algorithms such as dynamic scaling, quality of service, fault tolerance and load balancing algorithms.

C-MART contains multiple components that are comment in current commercial websites, such as the ability to use a scalable and distributed database for data storage, and a search engine to help users find information. It also contains a deployment server to allow C-MART to be easily deployed and dynamically scaled throughout experimentation.
